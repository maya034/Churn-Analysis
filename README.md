# Telecom-Churn-Analysis
Exploring and analyzing the data to discover key factors responsible for customer churn and come up with ways/recommendations to ensure customer retention.
Predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs. Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata. The raw data contains 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features). The “Churn” column is our 




 The AIR Worldwide Wildfire Model is a probabilistic wildfire model that is used to assess the risk of wildfire losses in the United States. The model covers the 13 western states where the most significant loss-causing wildfires have occurred.
The AIR Wildfire Model incorporates the following factors into its calculations:
Weather: The model uses historical weather data to simulate the weather conditions that are most conducive to wildfire ignition and spread.
Fuels: The model uses data on the type and amount of vegetation in an area to estimate the fire intensity and spread rate.
Topography: The model uses data on the terrain in an area to estimate the fire spread rate and the likelihood of a fire spotting (jumping to another location).
Wildland-urban interface (WUI): The model identifies areas where human development meets or intermingles with undeveloped wildland. These areas are at high risk of wildfire because they have a combination of combustible fuels and structures that can be easily damaged or destroyed by fire.
Mitigation: The model accounts for the effects of mitigation measures such as fire breaks, defensible space, and fire-resistant construction.
The AIR Wildfire Model produces a variety of outputs, including:
Expected annual losses: The average amount of losses that are expected to occur each year.
Maximum probable losses: The largest amount of losses that could occur in a single event.
Return periods: The average time between events that cause losses of a certain size.
The AIR Wildfire Model is used by insurers, reinsurers, and other stakeholders to assess wildfire risk and to develop risk management strategies. The model is also used by governments to develop policies to mitigate wildfire risk.
Here are some of the key features of the AIR Wildfire Model:
It is the most comprehensive wildfire model in the world, covering the 13 western states where the most significant loss-causing wildfires have occurred.
It is a probabilistic model, which means that it can estimate the probability of a wildfire occurring and the severity of the losses that could be sustained.
It is constantly being updated to reflect the latest scientific understanding of wildfire risk and the changing climate.
It is used by a wide range of stakeholders, including insurers, reinsurers, governments, and businesses.
The AIR Wildfire Model is an essential tool for understanding and managing wildfire risk. It provides a valuable resource for stakeholders who are looking to protect themselves from the financial impact of wildfires.
