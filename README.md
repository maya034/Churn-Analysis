When considering various types of disasters like hurricanes, floods, and fires, the key damage attributes to annotate will vary depending on the nature of the disaster. Below is a detailed list of key damage attributes for each type of disaster, which can be used to annotate satellite images:

### 1. Hurricane Damage Attributes

**a. Roof Damage:**
- Missing shingles or tiles.
- Holes or punctures.
- Entire roof sections blown off.

**b. Structural Damage:**
- Collapsed walls.
- Visible interior structures (due to missing walls or roof sections).
- Tilted or leaning buildings.

**c. Debris:**
- Debris scattered around the property (e.g., tree limbs, building materials).
- Vehicles or large objects displaced.

**d. Water Damage:**
- Flooding around the property.
- Water lines or marks on buildings indicating water level rise.
- Damaged or submerged infrastructure (e.g., roads, bridges).

**e. Vegetation Damage:**
- Uprooted or broken trees.
- Damaged landscaping.

### 2. Flood Damage Attributes

**a. Standing Water:**
- Areas with visible standing water around or inside properties.
- Roads and paths covered with water.

**b. Water Lines:**
- Visible water lines on buildings indicating the height of floodwaters.
- Mud or silt deposits around the property.

**c. Structural Damage:**
- Walls or foundations weakened or collapsed due to water pressure.
- Buildings partially or completely submerged.

**d. Debris:**
- Floating debris around the property.
- Accumulated debris near water bodies or drainage systems.

**e. Infrastructure Damage:**
- Damaged roads and bridges.
- Submerged or eroded infrastructure.

### 3. Fire Damage Attributes

**a. Burnt Structures:**
- Completely burnt buildings.
- Partially burnt structures with visible scorch marks.

**b. Roof Damage:**
- Roof sections burnt or collapsed.
- Scorched or missing roofing materials.

**c. Smoke Damage:**
- Soot and smoke stains on buildings.
- Discoloration of walls and roofs due to smoke.

**d. Vegetation Damage:**
- Burnt or charred trees and plants.
- Burnt ground cover or grass.

**e. Debris:**
- Rubble and ash piles.
- Burnt remnants of structures or vehicles.

### 4. General Damage Attributes (Applicable to All Disasters)

**a. Infrastructure Damage:**
- Damaged roads, bridges, and utility poles.
- Broken or damaged utility lines (e.g., power lines, water pipes).

**b. Environmental Impact:**
- Erosion and landslides.
- Changes in landscape due to the disaster.

**c. Human Activity Indicators:**
- Emergency response vehicles and personnel.
- Temporary shelters or relief camps.

### Annotating Damage Attributes

**1. Bounding Boxes:**
- Draw rectangular boxes around damaged areas.
- Label each box with the appropriate damage type (e.g., "Roof Damage", "Flooding").

**2. Polygons:**
- Draw precise polygon shapes around irregularly shaped damaged areas.
- Useful for detailed annotations of complex damage patterns.

**3. Segmentation Masks:**
- Create pixel-level annotations where each pixel is classified as part of a specific damage type.
- Provides the most detailed and precise representation of damage.

### Example Annotation Workflow

**1. Tools:**
- Use annotation tools like Labelbox, CVAT, or VGG Image Annotator (VIA).

**2. Steps:**
- **Load Image:** Open the satellite image in the annotation tool.
- **Select Tool:** Choose the appropriate annotation tool (bounding box, polygon, segmentation).
- **Draw Annotations:** Mark the areas of damage and label them with the corresponding damage type.
- **Save Annotations:** Save the annotations in a structured format (JSON, XML).

**3. Quality Control:**
- **Review Annotations:** Ensure annotations are accurate and consistent.
- **Validate with Experts:** Have domain experts review a subset of annotations to ensure quality.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Continuously refine annotations based on feedback.

By comprehensively annotating these key damage attributes, you can create a rich dataset that captures the impact of various disasters. This dataset can then be used to train models to automatically detect and assess damage in new satellite images. If you need more specific examples or further details on any part of this process, let me know!



Hi Nishant, The data we filled has mismatches. The counts for the target variable conditions (easy, medium, hard) are imbalanced: medium has 900 and hard has 100, with no easy examples. This imbalance makes modeling difficult. We need to refill the data to ensure all three categories are approximately equal for better model performance.
