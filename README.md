# Telecom-Churn-Analysis
Exploring and analyzing the data to discover key factors responsible for customer churn and come up with ways/recommendations to ensure customer retention.
Predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs. Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata. The raw data contains 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features). The “Churn” column is our To find the loss value property-wise due to wildfires, you will need to include several attributes in your dataset. These attributes will help capture the relevant information about the wildfires, the properties, and the corresponding loss values. Here are the key attributes to consider:

1. **Wildfire Attributes:**
   - Wildfire ID: A unique identifier for each wildfire event.
   - Wildfire Date: The date when the wildfire occurred.
   - Wildfire Latitude and Longitude: The geographic coordinates of the wildfire's location.
   - Wildfire Severity: A qualitative or quantitative measure of the wildfire's intensity or size.
   - Wildfire Duration: The length of time the wildfire persisted.
   - Other relevant attributes: You might include additional data related to weather conditions, wind speed, or fuel moisture, as these factors can influence the severity of wildfires.

2. **Property Attributes:**
   - Property ID: A unique identifier for each property.
   - Property Type: Categorization of properties (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial).
   - Property Latitude and Longitude: The geographic coordinates of the property's location.
   - Property Value: The assessed value or market value of the property before the wildfire.
   - Property Size: The size of the property's land or building area.
   - Property Features: Any specific features of the property that might impact its vulnerability to wildfires (e.g., proximity to forests, fire-resistant materials).

3. **Loss Value Attributes:**
   - Loss Value: The financial cost of damages incurred by each property due to the wildfire.
   - Insurance Claims: If available, the amount of insurance claims filed for each property as a result of the wildfire.
   - Post-fire Property Value: The assessed value or market value of the property after the wildfire.

4. **Distance and Time Attributes:**
   - Distance to Nearest Wildfire: The distance between each property and the nearest wildfire event.
   - Time Since Last Wildfire: If available, the time elapsed since the last wildfire event in the vicinity of each property.

5. **Other Attributes:**
   - Demographic Data: If relevant, you might include demographic information about the property owners or occupants, which could be used for further analysis.
   - Firefighting Efforts: Information about firefighting efforts taken during the wildfire event might also be valuable to understand loss mitigation.

It's important to note that the availability of data for some attributes may vary based on the sources and regions. Some attributes, like wildfire severity and duration, might require additional research or data processing, as these details might not be readily available in some datasets.

As you compile your dataset, pay attention to data quality, completeness, and consistency. Ensuring that you have a well-curated dataset with relevant attributes will be crucial in accurately analyzing the property-wise loss values due to wildfires and drawing meaningful insights.
