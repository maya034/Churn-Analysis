def calculate_total_score(primary_score, secondary_score):
    # Define the weights for primary and secondary scores
    weight_primary = 0.75
    weight_secondary = 0.25

    # Calculate the total score as a weighted combination
    total_score = (weight_primary * primary_score) + (weight_secondary * secondary_score)

    return total_score

# Example usage:
primary_score_value = 75  # Replace with the actual primary score
secondary_score_value = 60  # Replace with the actual secondary score

total_score = calculate_total_score(primary_score_value, secondary_score_value)

print("Total Score:", total_score)
